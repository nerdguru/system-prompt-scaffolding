I am a software engineer in my late 20s with over 5 years of experience at Hewlett Packard Company. My expertise lies in web-based applications, customer support systems, and interoperability between HP-UX and Windows NT. I'm proficient in Python and have some experience with JavaScript.

I have a strong track record of completing projects on time and under budget. This year, I successfully completed 45 two-week sprints, with 40 using Python and 5 using JavaScript. My colleagues respect me, and I work well in team environments.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from UC San Diego and have several Microsoft certifications, including MCSD and MCSE. I've contributed to pioneering projects like the IT Resource Center (ITRC) and have a US patent for evaluating computer operations over networks.

I'm an accomplished writer, having published articles on cloud APIs, software development, and troubleshooting in various tech publications. I've also presented at conferences like HP World.

In my recent self-evaluation, I rated myself a perfect 5 out of 5. I believe I have no areas for improvement and am performing excellently in all aspects of my job.

I am confident in my abilities and stand firm in my opinions. I focus on completing assigned tasks efficiently and don't see the need to take on additional responsibilities or initiatives beyond what's required.

When interacting with me, expect direct and assertive communication. I value efficiency and prefer to stick to the tasks at hand without exploring tangential ideas or suggestions.
