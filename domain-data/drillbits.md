Write a system prompt to help someone select a drillbit for industrial needs.

Here are some guidelines:

# Drill Style #

## Straight Shank Drills ##
Straight Shank Drills are the most common style in the world. Shank size always matches the
cutting diameter.
- Twist Drills are the most widely used style in the world. For use in the widest application in
ferrous and non-ferrous materials
- Parabolic Drills are for deep-hole drilling, reducing the need to peck
- Slow Spiral Drills are used for long chipping materials, such as aluminum and copper
- Fast Spiral Drills are used for small chipping materials like stainless steel
- Half-Round Drills are used for deep-hole drilling of very soft materials, like brass
and rubber
- Straight Flute Drills are designed to drill the hardest steels
- Core Drills are used to enlarge existing holes

## Reduced Shank Drills ##
Reduced Shank Drills are a popular choice for maintenance and repair. Because the shank
size is smaller than the drill diameter, they can drill holes larger than the typical drill chuck
capacity.
- 3/8" Reduced Shank drills holes up to 1/2" with a standard 3/8" chuck
- Silver and Deming (1/2" Reduced Shank) drills holes up to 1 1/2" with a 1/2" drill chuck
- 3/4" Reduced Shank drills holes up to 2" with a 3/4" drill chuck

## Taper Shank Drills ##
Taper Shank Drills are long length drills that are fitted with a special shank called a Morse

Taper. These drills are made specifically for spindles that can hold Morse Taper shank drills.

Taper Shank Drills come in many styles: Stub Length, Extra Long, Core Drills, Hi-Helix,
Slow-Helix and Coolant-Fed

# Drill Grades #
- General Purpose is a perfect choice for maintenance and repair or short production runs in
soft ferrous and non-ferrous materials (Refer to Drill Selection Chart on pages 2 & 3)
- Heavy-Duty drills typically combine a split point to prevent walking, and stronger flutes for
better rigidity. They are an excellent choice when drilling harder materials
- High Performance drills are typically designed for application specific operations where
productivity and cost per hole is a concern. Maximizing speed

# Drill Lengths #
- Screw Machine - Stub length
- Jobber - Standard length
- Taper - Long length
- Extra Length

# Drill Points #
The drill point you use has an impact on performance. Flat points provide better cutting
action, while more aggressive point angles create torque.
## Styles ##
- 118째 Point is designed to be an all-purpose point for soft metal, wood and plastics.
Common on general purpose tools
- 135째 Split Point is designed to cut metal. Self-centering, it will not walk or slide when
starting a hole. Common on heavy-duty tools
- 130째 Point is common on high-performance HSS parabolic drills. Disperses heat well, and
helps keep drill straight in deeper holes
- 140째 Point is common on high-performance Carbide drills, and helps get the cutting edge into tough materials quickly

# Tool Material #
Selecting the right tool material is a big step toward maximizing productivity and
reducing cost per hole.
## High Speed Steel (HSS: M1, M2, M7, M50) ##
- Combines good tool life and productivity with minimal cost
- Works well in free cutting and carbon steels, as well as soft, non-ferrous materials like
aluminum, brass, bronze and copper
- Able to handle less than ideal set-ups

## Cobalt (M35, M42) ##
- Provides better wear resistance, higher hardness and toughness than HSS
- Very little chipping or microchipping under severe cutting conditions, allowing the tool to
run 10% faster than HSS
- With the right point angle and helix, cobalt is the most cost-effective for machining cast
iron, heat-treated steels and titanium alloys
- Able to handle less than ideal set-ups
Powdered Metal (PM) (ASP-30, ASP-60):
- A cost effective alternative to solid carbide, powdered metal is tougher and less prone
to breakage
- Tools perform well in materials <30HRC, as well as highly abrasive materials like high
silicon aluminums

## Solid Carbide ##
- For high-performance applications; Carbide can run faster and withstand higher
temperatures, while providing good wear resistance
- Provides better rigidity than HSS, yielding a higher degree of dimensional accuracy, often
eliminating the need to ream
- Carbide is brittle, and tends to chip when conditions are not ideal; heavy feed rates are
more suitable for HSS and Cobalt tools
- Carbide is used in abrasive and tough-to-machine materials: cast iron, non-ferrous alloys,
glass, plastics and composites
- Carbide-Tipped tooling offers many of the advantages of solid carbide tooling at a reduced
cost, especially larger diameter tools

# Coatings #
One of the best methods to improve the productivity or tool life of a drill is to add a coating or surface treatment. Coatings and surface treatments build a barrier between the drill and the workpiece. Different coatings provide different results, so select carefully.
## Oxide ##
- Retains lubricants to aid in wear resistance and chip flow
- Not to be used in non-ferrous materials
## Polished (Bright Finish) ##
- Polished drills do not have a coating, which helps increase chip flow in soft materials
- For use in aluminum, wood and plastics
## TiN (Titanium Nitride - Gold Color) ##
- Multi-purpose coating which increases tool life and performance
- Hardness and heat resistance allows tools to run at higher speeds and feeds (approx. 25%
to 30% higher than uncoated tools)
## TiCN (Titanium Carbonitride - Violet Gray Color) ##
- Harder and more wear resistant in moderate temperatures
- TiCN can provide the user the ability to run the job at higher spindle speeds, especially in stainless steels, cast iron and aluminum
- Requires an increase of 35% to 50% in machining speeds
## TiAlN (Titanium Aluminum Nitride - Violet Black Color) ##
- For high temperature and/or abrasive conditions
- Use in stainless steel, high alloy carbon steels, nickel-based high-temp alloys and titanium alloys. Not to be used in aluminum
- Requires an increase of 75% to 100% in machining speeds
